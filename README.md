# Film ratings app
A Flutter app for rating films

TODO (before V1 and public):
 - Removal from list
 - File storage for saved films
 - Add picture to readme
 - Release versions, and update repo description with where to find

Features:
 - Adding film ratings to a list

Planned features:
 - Changing adding entries into a '+' button that brings up a box, involving the next point
 - Searching through IMDb API for films (maybe storing them all in useful format? depends on format they appear in API and how easy retrieval is. cache may be nice for offline use)
 - Analytics
   - Numbers for specific film/director/actor/genre etc. (box with info)
     - average rating, times seen, most watched film by-director/with-actor/in-genre
     - ratings graph over time
   - Ranking charts for film/director/actor/genre etc. (horizontal bar chart)
     - by: average ratings, times seen
     - sort high/low
   - Distribution charts (vertical bar chart)
     - number of times rated 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, etc. (option for granularity)
     - number of times rating a year
 - Define custom analytics that the user wants to see often, display on main analytics screen
