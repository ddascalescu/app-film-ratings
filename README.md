# Film ratings app
A Flutter app for rating films

TODO (before V1 and public):
 - Change list for a table with headings
 - Make items into ratings objects with fields
 - Removal from list
 - File storage for saved films
 - Release versions, and update repo description with where to find

Features:
 - Adding film ratings to a list

Planned features:
 - Changing adding entries into a '+' button that brings up a box, involving the next point
 - Searching through IMDb API for films (maybe storing them all in useful format? depends on format they appear in API and how easy retrieval is. cache may be nice for offline use)
 - Analytics
