 - Changing adding entries into a '+' button that brings up a box, involving the next point
 - Make main table sortable by any column
 - Make columns hidable
 - Searching through IMDb API for films (maybe storing them all in useful format? depends on format they appear in API and how easy retrieval is. cache may be nice for offline use)
